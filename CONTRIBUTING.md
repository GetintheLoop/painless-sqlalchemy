:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should point into `develop`. The `master` branch is used for releases
and should always reflect the latest pypi version.

## Releases (Admin only)
- Ensure setup.py has the correct version number
- Make github release with the correct version number against master
- Travis will auto deploy to pypi
